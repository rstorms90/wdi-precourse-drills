I moved here three years ago to climb and snowboard the mountains! Apart from climbing and snowboarding, I love to train jiu jitsu here in Boulder, write, and tinker with technology.</h4>

I'm coming from a graphic design background, and while that fed part of my creativity, there wasn't too much I was able to do with helping people. Technology has presented us with endless opportunities that I would like to be a part of. It seems that programming has so many paths as a career that you can find a specific niche. Eventually, I would love to work with a company that truly helps people!</h2>
